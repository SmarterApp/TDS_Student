        Used to control the format of the text entered by the candidate. This attribute affects the 
        way the value of the associated response variable should be interpreted by response processing 
        engines and also controls the way it should be captured in the delivery engine.

        plain - Indicates that the text to be entered by the candidate is plain text. This format is suitable 
        for short unstructured responses. Delivery engines should preserve white-space characters in candidate 
        input except where a response consists only of white-space characters, in which case it should be treated 
        as an empty string (NULL).

        preFormatted - Indicates that the text to be entered by the candidate is pre-formatted and should be 
        rendered in a way consistent with the definition of pre in [XHTML]. Delivery engines must preserve 
        white-space characters except where a response consists only of white-space characters, in which case 
        it should be treated as an empty string (NULL).

        xhtml - Indicates that the text to be entered by the candidate is structured text. The value of the response
        variable is text marked up in XHTML. The delivery engine should present an interface suitable for capturing 
        structured text, this might be plain typed text interpreted with a set of simple text markup conventions such 
        as those used in wiki page editors or a complete WYSIWYG editor.

        should use the value of this attribute (if provided) instead of their default placeholder text 
        when this is required. Implementors should be aware of the issues concerning the use of default

        is required for progression through a test. This could be done by providing an illustrative
