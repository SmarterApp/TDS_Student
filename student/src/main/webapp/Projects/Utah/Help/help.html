      	<h3 id="one">Test Rules</h3>
  	
  	  <h4>Basic Test Rules</h4>
  	  <ul>
   	  <li>You must answer each question. You can answer a question and flag it (mark it for review), then return to marked questions later to change your answer.)</li>
  	  <li>You must answer all questions on a page before moving on to the next page. Some pages contain multiple questions. You may need to use the vertical scroll bar to view all questions on a page.</li>
  	  </ul>
  	  
  	  <h4>Pause Rules</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>You can pause your test at any time. 
            <ul>
            <li><strong>If your test is paused for less than 20 minutes,</strong> you can review questions you already answered.</li>
            <li><strong>If your test is paused for more than 20 minutes,</strong> you cannot review questions you already answered. The only exceptions are if you pause on a page that has at least one unanswered question or you are taking the Writing test.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>When you resume the test, you will see the first page that has unanswered questions.</li>
            <li>If your test is idle for 30 minutes, the system will automatically pause the test and log you out.</li>
            <!--<li>All answers are saved immediately; you do not lose them when test is paused. </li>-->
  	  </ul>
      
      <div style ="border:2px dashed #000; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px;">
<p><em><strong>For Writing:</strong></em></p>
          <ul>
              <li>You can pause the Writing test for as long as you want. You can review your responses until you submit the test. </li> 
              <li>If your Writing test is idle for 30 minutes, the system will automatically pause the test and log you out.</li>
          </ul>
         
</div>
      	
    <!-- <h4>Navigation Rules</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>You cannot move forward in the test until all questions on the current page have been answered.</li>
            <li>You can navigate to any available test page by clicking the [<strong>Back</strong>] or [<strong>Next</strong>] buttons or selecting a page from the "Questions" drop-down list at the top of the page.</li>

    <h3 id="two">About Text-to-Speech</h3>
    
            <p> In the secure browser, you can listen to test instructions, passages, and questions as appropriate. Some students may have Descriptive Audio as an accommodation in addition to text-to-speech. <br />
           <em>Note for Reading, Language & Listening tests: Some passages will not be read aloud.</em></p>
          
           <ul>

                   <em>Note: You can select a small portion of text, such as a word, phrase, or paragraph, and right-click to listen to that selection only.</em>
               </li>
               </ul>
               <ul>
               <li>To listen to a question or answer options, right-click on the question area or on an answer option and select the [<strong>Speak</strong>] option you want.
                   <ul>
                       <li>Select [<strong>Speak Question</strong>] to listen only to the question.</li>
                       <li>Select [<strong>Speak Question and Options</strong>] to listen to the multiple-choice question and answer options.</li>
                       <li>Select [<strong>Speak Option</strong>] to listen only to the answer option. (If you want to listen to answer option A, right-click on that answer option and select [<strong>Speak Option A</strong>].</li>
