  	  <ul>
   	  <li>You must answer each question. You can answer a question and mark (flag) it for review, and then return to marked questions later to change or review your answer.</li>
  	  <li>You must answer all questions on a page before moving on to the next page. Some pages contain multiple questions. You may need to use the vertical scroll bar to view all questions on a page.</li>
      <li>For <em>ELA Reading, Language, and Listening</em> tests, you can move through the questions on each page, and answer them in any order. However, you will need to answer all of the questions on the page before clicking [<strong>Next</strong>] to move to the next test page.</li>
