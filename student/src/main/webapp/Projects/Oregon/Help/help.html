  	<h3><a name="two" id="two"></a>Test Rules</h3>
  	
  	  <h4>Basic Test Rules</h4>
  	  <ul>
   	  <li>You cannot skip items. (You can mark an item for review and return to it later.)</li>
  	  <li>You must answer all items on a page before moving on to the next page. Some pages contain multiple items. You may need to use the vertical scroll bar to view all items on a page.</li>
  	  <li>You may review past items and change your answer (see Pause Rules below).</li>
  	  </ul>
  	  
  	  <h4>Pause Rules</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>You can pause your test at any time. You will be presented with a warning message asking you to verify that you want to pause the test.
            <ul>
            <li><strong>If your test is paused for less than 20 minutes,</strong> you can review items you already answered.</li>
            <li><strong>If your test is paused for more than 20 minutes,</strong> you cannot review items you already answered. (The only exception is if you pause on a page that has at least one unanswered item.)</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>When you resume the test, you will see the first page that has unanswered items.</li>
            <li>If your test is idle for 20 minutes, the system will automatically pause the test and log you out.</li>
            <li>All answers are saved immediately; you do not lose them when test is paused. </li>
  	  </ul>
      <p><strong>The pause rule does NOT apply to OAKS Writing and ELPA tests.</strong> You may review your answers after the test has been paused for 20 minutes. <br /><em>ELPA Note: Once you complete an ELPA section, you cannot go back to it.</em> </p>
	
     <h4>Navigation Rules</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>You cannot move forward in the test until all items on the current page have been answered.</li>
            <li>You can navigate to any available test page by clicking the [<strong>Back</strong>] or [<strong>Next</strong>] buttons or selecting a page from the "Past/Marked Questions" drop-down list at the top of the page.</li>

    <h3><a name="three" id="three"></a>About Print-on-Request and Computer-Based Read-Aloud</h3>
    
   <ul>
       <li><strong>Print-on-Request</strong> <br />
           If you are taking a Reading test, you can request a printout of reading passages. You cannot print Reading items. For all other tests or to print Reading items, you need a Print-on-Request accommodation.   
           <ul>
               <li>To print a reading passage, click the [<strong>Print Passage</strong>] button. Your print request will be sent to your TA for approval.</li>
               <br />
               <li>To print an item, click the printer icon for that item. Your print request will be sent to your TA for approval.</li>
             </ul>    
       </li>
       <br />
       <li><strong>Computer-Based Read-Aloud (Speak)</strong> <br />
           If you have a Computer-Based Read-Aloud accommodation, you can listen to your test. 
           <ul>
               <li>To listen to a passage, right-click anywhere on the passage and select the [<strong>Speak</strong>] option you want. <br />
                   <em>Note: You can also select a paragraph and right-click to listen to that paragraph only.</em>
               </li>
               <br />
               <li>To listen to an item or answer options, right-click in that item area and select the [<strong>Speak</strong>] option you want.
                   <ul>
                       <li>Select [<strong>Speak Question</strong>] to listen only to the question.</li>
                       <li>Select [<strong>Speak Question and Options</strong>] to listen to the question and all the answer options. (This is available for multiple-choice questions.)</li>
