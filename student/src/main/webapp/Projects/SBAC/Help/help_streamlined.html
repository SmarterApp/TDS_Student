      <h4>Multiple-Choice Items</h4>
      <p>Multiple-choice items require you to select one response option. The response area will display several multiple-choice options as radio buttons. You must select a radio button.</p>

      <ol>
          <li>After listening to the question text, press the [Tab] key twice.
JAWS will read aloud the option letter and option text. If the option is an image, JAWS will read the text description associated with the image.</li>
          <li>To navigate between each response option, use the [Tab] and [Shift] + [Tab] commands. You can also use the Up and Down arrow keys to move between options. JAWS will read aloud the corresponding option letter and option text.</li>
          <li>To select an response option in focus as your response, press the [space bar] key. The radio button will be selected and JAWS will read “Enter.”</li>
      </ol>
<br />

      <h4>Multi-Select Items</h4>
      <p>Multi-select items require you to select more than one response option. The response area will display several response options as checkboxes. You must select at least one checkbox.</p>

      <ol>
          <li>After listening to the question text, press the [Tab] key twice. This will take you to the first response option. JAWS will read aloud the option letter and option text that is in focus. If the option is an image, JAWS will read the text description associated with the image.</li>
          <li>To navigate between each response option, use the [Tab] and [Shift] + [Tab] commands. 
JAWS will read aloud the corresponding option letter and option text.</li>
          <li>To select an response option in focus as your response, press the [space bar] key. A check mark will appear for that response option and JAWS will read “Space.”</li>
      </ol>
      <br />

      <h4>Hot Text Items</h4>
      <p>Hot text items require you to select at least one word, phrase, or sentence. For these item types, it is critical to follow the instructions provided in the item. Some items may tell you to select two responses. Others may tell you to select one response.</p>
      <p><em>Note: Each selectable text area is pre-defined. If you select a phrase or sentence, all the words in that text area will automatically be marked as selected. </em></p>

      <ol>
         <li>After listening to the question text, press the [Tab] key twice. This will take you to the first selectable word, phrase, or sentence. 
JAWS will read aloud the text that is in focus.</li>
          <li>To navigate between each selectable text area, use the [Tab] and [Shift] + [Tab] commands. 
JAWS will read aloud the selectable text.</li>
          <li>To choose a selectable text area in focus as your response, press the [Enter] key. JAWS will announce the text is checked.</li>
      </ol>
      <br />

      <h4>Edit Task Items</h4>
      <p>Edit task items require you to replace an incorrect selectable word or phrase. For these item types, it is critical to follow the instructions provided in the item. </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Some edit task items require you to enter the response into a text box. </li>
          <li>Some edit task items require you to select a response from a drop-down list.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><em>Important Notes About JAWS and Edit Task Items:</em></p>
      <ul>
          <li>Each selectable text area is pre-defined. For selectable text, JAWS will indicate whether the word or phrase is clickable and then continue reading the rest of the sentence or line.</li>
          <li>Some edit task items require students to make changes that are punctuation-based (for example, students may be asked to replace a comma with a different punctuation mark). For these edit task items, JAWS will need to read in character mode.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><em>It is strongly recommended that students read through an entire item before editing text. Students can listen to the item as well as read it via an RBD or printout from an embosser. </em></p>

      <ol>
          <li>Use the Down arrow to read through each line of text. 
If a line of text has a selectable word or phrase, JAWS will say “clickable” after the word or phrase.</li>
          <li>Navigate to each selectable text field in the item. 
              <ul>
                  <li>Option 1: Return to the beginning of the item. 
                      <ul>
                          <li>Press [Shift] + [H].</li>
                          <li>Press [Tab] to go to the first selectable text field. </li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Option 2: Move backwards through the selectable text fields in the item.
                      <ul>
                          <li>Press [Shift] + [Tab].</li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>When the selectable text is in focus, press the [space bar]. This will open the edit menu. JAWS will read “Edit tools dialog” and provide additional instructions.
              <ul>
                  <li>Text box: Type in the replacement word or phrase. </li>
                  <li>Drop-down list: Use the Up and Down arrow keys to move between options in the list. JAWS will read aloud each option. To select an option, press [Enter].</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Press [Tab] to navigate to the [OK] button in the edit menu. Press [Enter]. The edit menu will close and the item will be back in focus.</li>
      </ol>
      <br />

      <h4>Open Response Items</h4>
      <p>Open-response items require you to enter text into a text box. You may be asked to write a sentence or paragraph. </p>
      <ol>
          <li>Read the question and then use the [Tab] command to move to the response area. JAWS will read “Edit, type in text.”</li>
          <li>When you are done entering a response, press [Tab]. You will leave the text box and move to the next item on the page.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Open Response Items with Text Formatting Row</h4>
      <p>Open-response items require you to enter text into a text box. You may be asked to write a sentence, paragraph, or essay. These items include a row for formatting text. Formatting options include bold, underline, italics, numbered bulleting, symbol bulleting, and more.</p>

      <ol>
