  	<h3><a name="two" id="two"></a>Test Rules</h3>
  	
  	  <h4>Basic Test Rules</h4>
  	  <ul>
   	  <li>You cannot skip questions. (You can flag [mark] a question for review and return to it later.)</li>
  	  <li>You must answer all questions on a page before moving on to the next page. Some pages contain multiple questions. You may need to use the vertical scroll bar to view all questions on a page.</li>
  	  <li>You may review past questions and change your answer (see Pause Rules below).</li>
  	  </ul>
  	  
  	  <h4>Pause Rules</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>You can pause your test at any time. You will be presented with a warning message asking you to verify that you want to pause the test.
            <ul>
            <li><strong>If your test is paused for less than 20 minutes,</strong> you can review questions you already answered.</li>
            <li><strong>If your test is paused for more than 20 minutes,</strong> you cannot review questions you already answered. (The only exception is if you pause on a page that has at least one unanswered question.)</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>When you resume the test, you will see the first page that has unanswered questions.</li>
            <li>If your test is idle for 20 minutes, the system will automatically pause the test and log you out.</li>
            <li>All answers are saved immediately; you do not lose them when test is paused. </li>
  	  </ul>
      <br />
      <div style ="border:2px dashed #000; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px;">

<em><p><strong>For Performance Task Tests:</strong><br />
          If you are taking a test that includes performance tasks, you have no pause limit. You may pause the test for as long as you need to. </p></em>

     <h4>Navigation Rules</h4>
